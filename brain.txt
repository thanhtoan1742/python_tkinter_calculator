My brain stops working.
I need my brain to do anything.
If my brain work, it make everything better.

It's a negative feedback loop. 
The more my brain refuses to work, the harder to force it to work.
My brain just zone out and do nothing.
It only works on hormones and pure instincts.
Fuck.

It need a hard reset.
But things to come back to this negative loop.

I need a way to get out of the loop.

Getting into the loop is super easy.
Getting out of the loop is super hard.

I need a way to get out of the loop.
It has to be simple to execute, requires minimal will power.

I need a way to not fall into the loop.
It has to be, also, requiers less will power.
